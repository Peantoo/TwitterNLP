#Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling
##This project performs sentiment analysis and topic modeling on tweets related to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Using Twitter data, we aim to answer the following questions:

- What is currently the hottest AI tech on Twitter?
- Who is the most popular AI influencer?
- What is driving development of new AI technologies?
- The project is implemented using Python, MongoDB, and several machine learning and NLP libraries.

##How it works
This project connects to a MongoDB database, fetches tweets related to AI, and preprocesses the text using natural language processing techniques.

The processed data is then analyzed using various models:

Topic modeling is performed with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the most-discussed AI technologies on Twitter.
User influence is estimated based on metrics like followers, likes, and retweets.
Sentiment analysis identifies the factors driving the development of new AI technologies.

##Contributing
